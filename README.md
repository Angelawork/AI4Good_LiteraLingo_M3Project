# AI4Good_LiteraLingo Project

Misunderstandings, confusion, and barriers in building connections can arise from the challenges inherent in understanding the implied meaning and interpreting expressions literally, particularly for autistic individuals.

In this project, we are developing an application catered to autistic individuals that will help them learn and understand implied meanings. The translation feature of our app provides simple literal explanations of figurative language such as idioms or metaphors. The app also has a quiz feature that tests the individual's understanding of the expressions they learned over time. Thanks to the LiteraLingo app, autistic individuals will be able to strengthen their understanding of non-literal language and develop confidence during social interactions at school or work, at home, and in other settings.
